Uses:  
  - Selectable algorithm for computing Ï€ (Chudnovsky by default)  
  - C++ Threading  
  - SIMD  
  - Console Window for logging  
  - GDI rendering (LOL)  

## Building

 &nbsp;&ndash; Building requires Visual Studio 2017/2019/2022, the C++ workload, and WinSDK 19041 or higher installed.  
 &nbsp; For Windows XP Support, use the PiCalc-WinXP.sln, and install the v141_xp platform as per [Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/configuring-programs-for-windows-xp).
